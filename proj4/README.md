# Project 4
Our task is reading comprehension with the BoolQ dataset. Use a pretrained Transformer encoder of
your choice (from Hugging Face; it must not be finetuned on the BoolQ dataset yet), and a two-layer
classifier with a ReLU. Train the whole network end-to-end. Apply the correct learning rates.
